title: University of Oklahoma API
---

<p>This is a project to help jumpstart the API conversation at the University of Oklahoma (OU). This is not an official project of the university, just and outside-in effort looking to bring awareness of APis on campus.</p>
<p>You can read about the story behind this project on the update page, which we will publish regular updates to as things move forward. Currently we have three types of data already available on the OU website, and are working to identify which APIs could be launched first.</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="/low-hanging-fruit-tables.html">Tables</a></li>
	<li><a href="/low-hanging-fruit-spreadsheets.html">Spreadsheets</a></li>
	<li><a href="/low-hanging-fruit-xml.html">XML</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Right now this is just an API Evangelist project, and I'm having a conversation with a couple of API curious folks at OU. If you'd like to get involved in this project, you can contact <a href="http://kinlane.com/contact/">Kin Lane</a></a>, or preferrably use the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/university-of-oklahoma-api/issues"></a>Github issue management</a> for this project.</p>

<p>This project is part of larger work to move forward the API conversations at universities, and you can <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/">follow this research as a separate project</a>.</p>
